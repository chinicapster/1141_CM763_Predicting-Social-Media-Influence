# Predicting Social Media Influence: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Description

This research project develops and evaluates machine learning algorithms to predict which of two Twitter users is more influential based on social media metrics. Building upon the foundational work by Shimony Agrawal, we have significantly upgraded the analysis by expanding from 4 to 9 machine learning algorithms across four algorithm families (statistical methods, tree-based models, ensemble methods, and deep learning). The work challenges conventional assumptions about social influence by demonstrating that professional recognition metrics (listed_count) are stronger predictors than traditional follower counts, with practical implications for influencer marketing and KOL/KOC selection in e-commerce.

## Instructions to Reproduce Results

### Quick Start - Training Models

The entire analysis is contained in a single Jupyter notebook for ease of use.

1. **Navigate to the upgraded code:**
```bash
cd "[Group work] Upgraded code"
```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook "[Upgraded] Twitter_Analytics.ipynb"
```

3. **Run all cells:**
   - Click `Cell` → `Run All` or press `Shift + Enter` to execute each cell sequentially

The notebook will automatically:
- Load the dataset from `../[Original code] Social-Media-Analytics-Twitter/train.csv`
- Perform feature engineering (A/B ratio features)
- Train all 9 machine learning models
- Generate evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Display results with ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance plots

### Using the Interactive Chatbot

After training the models, you can use the interactive chatbot for real-time predictions:

```bash
cd "[Group work] Upgraded code"
python interactive_chatbot.py
```

The chatbot provides:

Enter User A's follower count: 50000
Enter User A's listed count: 1200
Enter User A's retweets received: 15000
... (continues for all features)

Prediction: User A is more influential
Confidence: 82.5%
```

### Comparison with Original Implementation

| Metric | Original (4 models) | Upgraded (9 models) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Best Accuracy | 81.00% (XGBoost) | 77.03% (Gradient Boosting) | Better generalization |
| Overfitting | Not reported | 4.66% (Gradient Boosting) | ✓ Low overfitting |

**Note:** Our Gradient Boosting model demonstrates superior generalization with only 4.66% overfitting compared to the highly overfit Random Forest (23.46%) and XGBoost (25.30%), making it more reliable for real-world deployment despite slightly lower training accuracy.

### Feature Importance (Top 5 Predictors)

Based on the best-performing Gradient Boosting model:

1. **A/B_listed_count** (~60%): Professional recognition through Twitter list inclusion
2. **A/B_follower_count** (~15%): Traditional follower metric
3. **A/B_network_feature_3** (~10%): Network topology indicator
4. **A/B_retweets_received** (~8%): Content virality measure
5. **A/B_network_feature_2** (~5%): Secondary network metric

### Key Insights

- **Gradient Boosting excels** with best validation accuracy (77.03%) and balanced performance (4.66% overfitting)
- **Ensemble methods dominate** top positions: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost lead performance
- **Overfitting challenge**: Random Forest (23.46%) and XGBoost (25.30%) show high overfitting despite strong validation scores
- **Transformer model** demonstrates excellent generalization (-0.67% overfitting) but moderate accuracy (67.03%)
- **Classical methods underperform**: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes achieve ~50-52% accuracy (near random)
- **Speed vs Performance tradeoff**: KNN is fastest (0.01s) but Transformer slowest (82.44s)
- **ROC-AUC scores** reveal Gradient Boosting (0.8635) has best discriminative ability
- **Cross-validation stability**: Transformer shows perfect consistency (0.00% CV Std), Gradient Boosting maintains low variance (1.70%)
- **Listed count dominates** as the most predictive feature with ~60% importance, challenging conventional focus on follower counts
- **Professional recognition** metrics are more reliable than raw popularity metrics for influence prediction

## Notes and Limitations

### Project Characteristics

- **Single Notebook Implementation:** All training code is contained in one Jupyter notebook for simplicity and reproducibility
- **Interactive Chatbot:** Separate Python script for user-friendly predictions
- **Dataset Included:** No separate download needed - dataset is in the repository
- **Well-Balanced Data:** Classes are balanced, eliminating need for resampling or SMOTE
- **Direct Usage:** No preprocessing pipeline required - notebook handles everything

### Limitations

1. **Dataset Temporal Constraint:** The Kaggle dataset represents a snapshot in time; Twitter metrics evolve rapidly
2. **Platform Specificity:** Findings are specific to Twitter (now X) and may not generalize to other social platforms
3. **Feature Availability:** Some network features are proprietary and not fully documented in the original dataset
4. **Binary Classification:** Influence is binary (A vs B), which may oversimplify nuanced influence relationships
5. **External Factors:** The model doesn't account for content quality, topic relevance, or temporal trends

### Technical Considerations

- **Negative Overfitting Ratio:** When validation accuracy exceeds training accuracy, this indicates strong regularization or beneficial validation set characteristics rather than poor model fit
- **Random State:** All models use `random_state=42` for reproducibility; results may vary slightly with different seeds
- **GPU Optional:** Neural network training benefits from GPU but works on CPU
- **Chatbot Deployment:** Requires trained model file; run notebook first to generate model

### Future Work

- Expand to multi-class influence classification (low, medium, high influence)
- Develop web-based interface (Flask/Django) for broader accessibility
- Incorporate temporal features and trend analysis
- Test generalizability across different social media platforms
- Develop real-time influence prediction API
- Investigate advanced deep learning architectures (LSTM, Transformers)
